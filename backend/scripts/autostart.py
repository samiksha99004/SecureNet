"""Started by Windows when the user signs in — only while the IDS is ON.

The "SecureNet Monitor" shortcut in the Startup folder (created when a user
turns the IDS on, removed when they turn it off) runs this with the venv's
pythonw.exe, so there is no window. It starts the SecureNet backend in the
background; the backend sees that the IDS was on, turns it back on and shows
one desktop notification. Output goes to backend/logs/autostart.log.
Does nothing when a SecureNet backend is already running.
Uses the ports START_SECURENET last chose (backend/data/ports.json), so the
dashboard finds the backend even when 8000/5173 belong to other programs.
